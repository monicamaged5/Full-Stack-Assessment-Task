# ProjectFlow

ProjectFlow is a lightweight project and task tracker for software teams.
Organizations own projects, projects own tasks, and tasks carry a status, a
priority and a discussion thread.

It is a TypeScript monorepo: a NestJS + MongoDB API and a Next.js App Router
frontend, sharing a small package of domain types and enums.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20.19+** (22 or 24 recommended)
- **pnpm 10+** — `npm install -g pnpm`
- **MongoDB 7+** running locally

On macOS:

```bash
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community@7.0
brew services start mongodb-community@7.0
```

Any reachable MongoDB works — point `MONGODB_URI` wherever you like.

---

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Environment setup

Configuration lives in a single `.env` file at the repository root; both apps
read it.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

| Variable              | Purpose                          | Default                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `MONGODB_URI`         | MongoDB connection string        | `mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/projectflow` |
| `JWT_SECRET`          | Signing secret for access tokens | — (required)                            |
| `JWT_EXPIRES_IN`      | Access token lifetime            | `7d`                                    |
| `API_PORT`            | Port the API listens on          | `4732`                                  |
| `WEB_ORIGIN`          | Origin allowed by CORS           | `http://localhost:3742`                 |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | API base URL used by the browser | `http://localhost:4732`                 |

The API refuses to boot if `MONGODB_URI` or `JWT_SECRET` is missing.

## Database

Make sure MongoDB is running, then load development data:

```bash
pnpm seed
```

The seed is repeatable — it clears the ProjectFlow collections and reinserts a
fresh organization, users, projects, tasks and comments.

## Running the apps

```bash
pnpm dev
```

- Web — <http://localhost:3742>
- API — <http://localhost:4732>

Both apps deliberately avoid the usual 3000/4000 defaults so they do not clash
with other projects. To move the web app, set `WEB_PORT` in your shell and
update `WEB_ORIGIN` in `.env` to match, so CORS keeps working:

```bash
WEB_PORT=3800 pnpm --filter @projectflow/web dev
```

The API port comes from `API_PORT` in `.env`; change `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to
match if you move it.

Run one at a time if you prefer:

```bash
pnpm --filter @projectflow/api dev
pnpm --filter @projectflow/web dev
```

## From a clean checkout

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
pnpm seed
pnpm dev
```

## Commands

| Command          | Description                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `pnpm dev`       | Run the API and web app in watch mode      |
| `pnpm build`     | Build every package and app                |
| `pnpm lint`      | ESLint across the workspace                |
| `pnpm typecheck` | TypeScript project-wide, no emit           |
| `pnpm test`      | API test suite (uses an in-memory MongoDB) |
| `pnpm seed`      | Reset and reload development data          |
| `pnpm format`    | Prettier write                             |

`pnpm test` does not need a running MongoDB — it starts a throwaway in-memory
server for the duration of the run. The first run downloads a MongoDB binary
(around 100 MB) and caches it.

## Development credentials

Seeded accounts, all sharing the password `Password123!`:

| Name         | Email                 | Access                    |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Ammar Yaser  | `ammar@example.com`   | Organization owner        |
| Sarah Ahmed  | `sarah@example.com`   | Organization admin        |
| Ahmed Hassan | `ahmed@example.com`   | Project manager on `ENG`  |
| Magd Ali     | `magd@example.com`    | Member of `ENG` and `WEB` |
| Outside User | `outside@example.com` | No organization           |

These are local development accounts only.

### API layering

Each module follows the same shape: controller → service → Mongoose model, with
DTOs validating input at the boundary. Controllers stay thin; business rules
live in services.

### Domain model

```
User
Organization        ── OrganizationMember ── User      (OWNER | ADMIN | MEMBER)
Organization  ── Project
Project             ── ProjectMember      ── User      (PROJECT_MANAGER | MEMBER)
Project       ── Task ── Comment
Task                 ── assigneeId -> User  (nullable)
Task                 ── TaskActivity        (assignee change history)
```

Membership is stored in its own collection rather than as arrays on the parent
document, so it can be indexed and queried directly. Both membership
collections carry a unique compound index on their two foreign keys.

Tasks are numbered per project and identified by a human-readable key derived
from the project key: `ENG-1`, `ENG-2`, `WEB-1`. The number is issued by an
atomic `$inc` on the project's own `taskCounter` field
(`findByIdAndUpdate(projectId, { $inc: { taskCounter: 1 } })`) rather than
`countDocuments`, so concurrent creation can't hand out the same number
twice. See `ASSESSMENT_NOTES.md` for the full write-up.

A task's `assigneeId` is a nullable reference to a project member. Every
change to it is recorded as a `TaskActivity` row (`TASK_ASSIGNEE_CHANGED`,
with `actor`/`from`/`to`), readable via `GET /tasks/:taskId/activity`.

### Authorization

`ProjectAccessService` answers "may this user touch this project?" in one
place. Access comes from either an elevated organization role (`OWNER` or
`ADMIN`, which grants access to every project in the organization) or an
explicit project membership row. `assertCanView` gates reads, `assertCanManage`
gates configuration and membership changes.

Authentication is a JWT bearer token. `JwtAuthGuard` is registered globally;
routes opt out with the `@Public()` decorator.

### API surface

```
POST   /auth/register
POST   /auth/login
GET    /auth/me

GET    /organizations

GET    /projects
POST   /projects
GET    /projects/:projectId
GET    /projects/:projectId/members
POST   /projects/:projectId/members

GET    /projects/:projectId/tasks
POST   /projects/:projectId/tasks
GET    /tasks/:taskId
PATCH  /tasks/:taskId
PATCH  /tasks/:taskId/status
PATCH  /tasks/:taskId/assignee
GET    /tasks/:taskId/activity
DELETE /tasks/:taskId

GET    /tasks/:taskId/comments
POST   /tasks/:taskId/comments
```

Errors share one shape:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "message": "You do not have access to this project",
  "error": "Forbidden"
}
```

### Frontend

Routes are thin; the work happens in `features/`. Server state is owned by
TanStack Query — query keys live in `lib/query-keys.ts` so invalidation stays
predictable — and local UI state stays in React. The API client in
`lib/api-client.ts` centralises the base URL, the auth header and error
parsing.

Components are server components by default; `"use client"` is added only where
interactivity or hooks require it.

## Technical Decisions

This section covers the task-assignment feature added for the technical
assessment. See `ASSESSMENT_NOTES.md` for the full reasoning, `BUG_REPORT.md`
for the production bug investigation, and `AI_LOG.md` for how AI tools were
used while building this.

- **Task numbering** now comes from an atomic `$inc` on `Project.taskCounter`
  instead of `countDocuments() + 1`, fixing a concurrent-creation race.
- **Assignment authorization**: assigning to someone else, or unassigning
  someone else's assignment, requires `canManage`
  (`OWNER`/`ADMIN`/`PROJECT_MANAGER`); self-assignment and self-unassignment
  are always allowed for any project member. A valid assignment target must
  be an explicit member of the project (`ProjectMembersService.findRole`).
- **Activity history** is a new `task_activities` collection, one row per
  assignee change, paginated newest-first via a `{ taskId, createdAt: -1 }`
  index, with actors resolved in a single batched user lookup (no N+1).
- **`updateStatus` now enforces `assertCanView`** — see `BUG_REPORT.md`; it
  previously performed no access check at all.
- No new runtime dependencies were added on either the API or the web app;
  the assignee selector is a small self-built combobox using the design
  tokens already in `components/ui`, since the project doesn't depend on a
  popover/combobox primitive and adding one for a single component didn't
  seem justified.

## Known Limitations

- Assignment strictly requires an explicit `ProjectMember` row for the
  target user — an `OWNER`/`ADMIN` who has implicit access to every project
  in their organization but never explicitly joined a given project cannot
  currently be assigned to its tasks. See `ASSESSMENT_NOTES.md` →
  "If I Had Two More Days" for the trade-off.
- No rate limiting on any endpoint, including `/auth/login`. Pre-existing
  gap, not introduced by this work.
- No real-time updates for activity/assignment — the frontend relies on
  query invalidation after a mutation, not a push channel.
- Task deletion (`TasksService.remove`) deletes comments and the task
  itself via `Promise.all`, which is not atomic across the two collections.
  See `ASSESSMENT_NOTES.md` observation #3.
